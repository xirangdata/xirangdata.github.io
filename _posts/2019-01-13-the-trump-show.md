## [特普朗秀，第二季上演](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/01/05/what-to-expect-from-the-second-half-of-donald-trumps-first-term)  

<br />

Donald Trump's nerve-jangling presidential term began its second half with a federal-government shut down, seesawing markets and the ejection of reassuring cabinet members like Generals John Kelly and James Mittis. As Mr Trump's opponents called this a disaster, his supporters lambasted their criticism as hysterical - wasn't everybody saying a year ago that it was sinister to have so many generals in the cabinet?  

唐纳德・特普朗令人神经紧张的总统任期的第二个两年以联邦政府关门，波动的市场，驱逐令人放心的内阁成员像约翰・凯利和詹姆士・马蒂斯将军们开场。当特普朗的反对者认为这是一场灾难时，他的支持者斥责反对者的批评是滑稽的——每个人一年前不都说内阁中有这么多将军太危险了么？  

A calm assessemnt of the Trump era requires those who admire America to unplug themselves from the news circle for a minute. As the next phase of the president's four-year term begins, three questions need answering. How bad is it really? How bad could it get? And how should Americans, and foreign governments, prepare for the Trump Show's second season?  

对特普朗时期的冷静评价需要那些仰慕美国的人暂时从新闻圈里抽离出来。当这四年总统任期的下一阶段开始的时候，有三个问题需要解答。现在有多糟糕？会变得多糟糕？还有美国人民和外国政府要怎么为特普朗秀的第二季作准备？   

Trump is so polarising that his critics brush off anything that might count as an achievement. Shortly before Christmas he signed a useful, bipartisan criminal-justice reform into law. Some of the regulatory changes to schools and companies have been  helpful. In foreign affairs the attemp to change the terms of America's economic relations with China is welcome, too. But any orthodox Republican president enjoying the backing of both houses of Congress might have achieved as much - or more.  

特普朗太极端了以至他的批评者们忽视了任何可能被看作成绩的事情。圣诞节前，他签署了一个有益的双党联立的刑事司法改革，使其成为法律。一些对学校和公司的管理制度改变也很有用。对外事务上，试图改变中美经济关系的条款也值得欢迎。但是，任何一个传统的由国会两院支持的共和党总统都能实现这一些，甚至更多。  

What makes out Mr Trump's first two years is his irrepressible instinct to act as a wrecker. His destructive tactics were supposed to topple a self-serving Washington elite, but the president's bullying, lying and sleaze have filled the swamp faster than it has drained. Where he has been at his most Trumpish moments - on immigration, North Korea, NATO - the knocking down has yet lead to much renewal. Mr Trump came to office with a mandate to rewrite America's immigration rules, make them merit-based, as in Canada. Yet because he and his staff are ham-fisted with Congress, that chance is now gone; Kim Jong Un still has his weapon programme and, having conceded nothing, now demands a reward from America; Europeans may pay more into their defense budgets at the president's urging. But america has spent half a century and billions of dollars building its relations with Europe. In just two years Mr Trump has taken a sledgehammer against them.  

特普朗前两年的不同之处在于他抑制不住的扮演破坏者的本能。他的破坏性策略本应颠覆一个自私自利的华盛顿精英，但是总统的霸凌、谎话和卑鄙让他在沼泽中越陷越深而无法抽身。在他曾有过的最特普朗的时刻——移民、北韩和北约——这种击倒也没有带来实质改变。特普朗带着重写规则，建立像加拿大一样基于价值评价移民体系的任务入主白宫，但是由于他和他的团队在面对国会时的笨手笨脚，这个机会已经没有了；金正恩还是有他的武器计划，没有任何退让，现在却要求得到美国的好处；在特普朗的要求下，欧盟也许会增加国防预算，但是美国已经用半个世纪的时间和无数的美元来建立同欧洲的关系，而不到两年他却已经对他们抡起了锤子。  

The next two years could be worse. For a start, Mr Trump's luck may be about to turn. In the first half of his term he has been fortunate. He was not faced by any shock of the sort his two predecessors had to deal with: 9/11, Afghanistan, Iraq, the financial crisis, Syria. Electoral triumph, a roaring economy and surging financial markets gave him an air of invulnerability.  

接下去的两年可能会变得更糟。作为开始，特普朗的好运也许到头了。在他的前半任期，他是幸运的。他没有面对过像他两个前任所面对的那种打击：9/11，阿富汗，伊拉克，经济危机和叙利亚。选举的胜利，腾飞的经济和繁荣的经济市场给了他一种无敌的感觉。  

Even without a shock, the weather has changed. Although the economy is still fairly strong, the suger-high from the tax cut is fading, and growth is slowing in China and Europe. Markets, which Mr Trump heralds as a proxy for economic success, are volatile. Republicans were trounced in the House in the mid-terms, the new Democratic majority will investigate the president's conduct, and at some point Robert Mueller, the special counsel, will complete his report on links between Russia and the Trump campaingn.  

即使没有打击，天也已经变了。虽然经济还算强劲，但减税带来的好处正在消减，而且中国和欧洲的增长也在减缓。被特普朗视为经济成功表征的市场，也不稳定。中期选举中，共和党在众议院被痛击。新的民主党多数派将调查总统的行为，特别检察官罗伯特・穆勒迟早会完成关于俄国同特普朗选举关系的报告。  

Over the past two years, Mr Trump has shown that he reacts to any adversity by lashing out without regard to the consequences. Neither the magnitude nor target of his reponse need bear on the provocation. In the past few weeks, he has announced troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan. Seemingly, it was partly because he was being criticised by pundits for failling to build a sounthern border-wall. The Afghanistan withdrawal was later walked back and the Syria one blurred, with the result that nobody can say what America's policy is (though the harm will remain). Now that his cabinet has lost its steadying generals, expect even more such destructive ambiguity.  

在过去两年中，特普朗面对任何逆境时，都以斥责回击而不顾后果。他回应的量级和对象甚至都与挑衅无关。在过去的几周，特普朗宣布从叙利亚和阿富汗撤军。看起来，这与他正在遭受权威人士关于未能建立南方边境墙的指责有一定关系。阿富汗的撤军随后被取消，但叙利亚的撤军仍不明朗，导致没有人能知道美国的政策（虽然危害还未消除）。现在他的内阁中失去了稳重的将军们，只会导致更多这种有害的不明朗。  

Moreover, when Mr Trump acts, he does not recognise boundaries, legal or ethical. He has already been implicated in two felonies and several of his former advisers are in or heading for prison. As his troubles amount, he will become less bound by institutional machinery. If Mr Mueller indicts a member of Mr Trump's family, the president may instruct his attorney - general to end the whole thing and make egregious use of his pardon powers. House Democrats might unearth documents suggesting that the  Trump Organisation was used to launder Russian money. What then?  

而且，当特普朗行动时，他并不理会法治或者道德上的边界。他已经卷入两宗重罪，他的多名前任顾问正在监狱或正走向监狱。随着他的麻烦越来越多，他会变得更加不受制于机构制度。如果穆勒起诉他的家族成员，总统可能指示他的律师就此结束整个事情，然后动用臭名昭著的总统特赦权。众议院民主党也许能揭秘反映特普朗组织曾经帮俄国洗钱的文件。那之后呢？  

Confusion, chaos and norm-breaking are how Mr Trump operates. If the federal government really were a business, the turnover of senior jobs in the White House would have investors dumping the stock. Mr Trump's interventions often accomplish the opposite of what he intends. His criticism of the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, for being too hawkish will, if anything, only make an independent-minded Fed more hawkish still. His own negotiators fear that he might undermine them if the mood takes him. Most of the senior staff who have left administration have said that he is self-absorbed, distracted and ill-informed. He demands absolute loyalty and, when he gets it, offers none in return.  

困惑、混乱和打破常规是特普朗的方式。如果联邦政府是一个商业机构，白宫高级职位的流动率会让投资者抛售股票。特普朗的干预往往起到他预想的反作用。他关于联邦储备主席杰罗姆・鲍威尔想法过于鹰派的指责，如果有作用，只让独立意志的联邦政府显得更加鹰派。他自己的幕僚害怕当他心情不好时对他们不利。大部分离开政府办事机构的资深人员说他自私，精神无法集中和偏听。他要求绝对的忠诚，但当得到后又不会回报。  

How should Congress and the world prepare for what is coming? Foreign allies should engage and hedge; work with Mr Trump when they can, but have a paln B in case he lets them down. Democarts in control of the House have a fine line to tread. Some are calling for Mr Trump to be impeached but, as of now, the Republican-controlled Senate will not convict him. As things stand, it would be better if the verdict comes at the ballot box. Instead, they must hold him to account, but not play into his desire that they serve as props in his permanent compaign.  

国会和世界该怎么准备接下来的事情呢？国外友邦应该参与又对冲，尽量与特普朗合作，但同时有另一个计划以防他让他们失望。控制着众议院的民主党需要小心翼翼。一些人要求弹劾特普朗，但是现在，由共和党控制的参议院并不会起诉他。就目前看，最好是由选举决定。同时，他们必须让他履行职责，而不是遂他的意而服务于他的永久选战策略。  

The Republicans in the Senate find themselves in a familiar dilemma. Speak out and risk losing their seats in a primary; stay slient and risk losing their party and their consciences. More should follow Milton Romney, who marked his arrival in Senate this week by criticising Trump's conduct. His return to politics is welcome, as is the vibrant opposition to Mr Trump by activists and civil society evident in the mid-terms. Assailed by his presidency, American democracy is fighting back.  

参议院的共和党人发现他们处于一个熟悉的窘境。说出来，冒失去初选位置的险；保持沉默，冒党派失败和良心沦丧的险。更多人应该像米特・罗姆尼，以对特普朗行为的批评来表明自己这周来到参议院。他重回政坛是受欢迎的，正如中期选举所体现的社会人士和团体对特普朗的有力反对。被他的任期伤害后，美国民主正在回击。  

After two chaotic years, it is clear that the Trump Show is something to be endured. Perhaps the luck will hold and Amerca and the world will muddle through. But luck is a slender hope on which to build prosperity and peace.  

经过混乱的两年，很明显特普朗秀很难熬。或许幸运将持续，美国和世界会撑过去。但是，单靠幸运是没办法建立繁荣和和平的。
